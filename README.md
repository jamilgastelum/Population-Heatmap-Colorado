# Population Scatterplot - Colorado

In this project, I aimed to create a visually appealing scatterplot that showcases the population distribution across the beautiful state of Colorado.

My inspiration for this project came from my recent experience as a research assistant for my economics professor. As part of that internship, I had the opportunity to create heatmaps of Colorado and its counties to highlight different economic indicators such as GDP, Per Capita Income, and Median Household Income. Although I used Tableau for that project, I wanted to explore a different tool and decided to create a map using Python instead.

The result is a stunning scatterplot that highlights the border lines for each county in Colorado, providing a clear picture of the population density in each area. The use of a color-scale adds an additional layer of detail, making it easy to understand the relative population sizes across the state.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvements.
